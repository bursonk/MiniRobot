## General info
This project contains the custom chassis and PCB design files I created for a University Design Project in February 2020. 

## Technologies
* Teensy3.6
* KiCad
* SolidWorks

## Project Status
Due to various manufactures of component boards, location of mounting holes may need to be altered.

### To Do List
- [x] Update files to reflect final design
- [ ] Complete Project Documentation

## Features
The sumo robot features a 10cm X 10cm Chassis.
