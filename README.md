## General info
This project contains the custom chassis and PCB design files I created for a University Design Project in February 2020. 

Additionally, a folder of SolidWorks parts with the electrical components used in the robot is included. Parts in this 
folder are used for the robot assembly design and were obtained from SolidWorks resources, from the manufacturer, or developed by me. 

## Technologies
*Teensy3.6
*KiCad
*SolidWorks

## Project Status
Due to various manufactures of component boards, location of mounting holes may need to be altered.

### To Do List
